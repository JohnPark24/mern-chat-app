## Real Time Chat Application with MERN Stack

This app is created my [burkaorkmez](https://github.com/burakorkmez)

This project is a real-time chat application built with the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack along with Socket.io for real-time messaging. 
It includes authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT), online user status indication, global state management with Zustand, and error handling on both the server and client sides. 
The application utilizes TailwindCSS for styling with Daisy UI components.

### How It's Made

**Tech Used:** MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js, Socket.io, JWT, TailwindCSS, Daisy UI

This project is a full-stack application leveraging the power of the MERN stack. MongoDB is used as the database to store chat messages and user data. 
Express.js is utilized for the backend server, which handles API requests and authentication using JWT. React.js is used for the frontend, providing a dynamic and responsive user interface. 
Socket.io enables real-time communication between clients for instant messaging functionality. TailwindCSS and Daisy UI are used for styling and component design, ensuring a modern and visually appealing UI.

The application is structured with modular components on the frontend, utilizing React Context for managing global state, 
Zustand for local state management, and implementing error handling both on the client and server sides to provide a smooth user experience.

### Optimizations

Optimizations may include performance enhancements, such as optimizing API requests, implementing caching strategies for static assets, or refactoring components for improved rendering speed. 
Highlight any significant improvements made during development that enhanced the efficiency or scalability of the application.

Some things to add in the future include changing profile icons, changing emojis, and adding emojis in the chat.

### Lessons Learned

No matter the level of experience, building applications is a continuous learning process. Throughout this project, I gained insights into real-time communication using Socket.io, 
implementing authentication with JWT, and managing complex state using React Context and Zustand.
